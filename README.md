# file-matcher examples

This repository shows three simple examples on how to use the file-matcher module.

The examples are:

* ***basic-search-es*** - simple file look up using Ecmascript.
* ***basic-search-ts*** - simple file look up using Typescript.
* ***events-search-ts*** - shows how to deal with the library events.


## Steps to use it 

1. First clone the file matcher examples repository:
``` git clone https://git.com/mauriciovigolo/file-matcher-examples.git ``` 

2. Access any folder example and type:
``` npm i ``` to install the dependencies.

3. For typescript examples:
    - Be sure that you have typescript installed globally. `npm i -g typescript@latest`.
    - Need to run ```tsc``` from command line.
    - If you make any changes in the example, erase the build directory and run tsc again.

4. Execute the code as:
``` node index ```
